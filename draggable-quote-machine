Finally, I have been able to create a quote machine, a draggable DIV element, and now infused both to get a draggable quote machine.

I was super excited one the DIV element which lay flat on its back moved with each mouse drag. Yaaay.
So, if you wonder what the hype's all about, let me explain.


## INTRODUCTION ##
As part of the #100DaysofCode and #301DaysofJavasdript, and everything in between, various programming projects emerged.
I decided to join the community and make some of my own works using HTML, Javascript, CSS and some imagination.

In light to this, I decided to use these entities to spice up my programming talent.

## WHY #100DAYSOFCODE / #301DAYSOFJAVASCRIPT ?

Well, as they say, Practice makes perfect, so we decided to house these programming projects under the hashtags,  #100DaysofCode and #301DaysofJavasdript.

Visit twitter.com and search for the aforementioned hashtags to learn more. Who knows? One could get inspired to "Think Code, Write Code."

Thank for visiting.
